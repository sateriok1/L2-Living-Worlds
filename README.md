# Interlude: Living World - an offline/solo Lineage 2 server

A fork of **L2J Mobius CT_0 Interlude** turned into a single-player **"Living World"**:
you log in and the server *feels* populated - towns full of NPCs, working private
shops, trade chat, field hunters, and recruitable combat parties - without any other
humans online. Play the classic Interlude chronicle solo, at your own pace, on your own
machine.

## What makes it a "Living World"

- **Populated towns** - data-driven NPC "fake players" wander the cities with procedural
  identities and run **functional private shops** you can actually buy from.
- **Field hunters** - clientless phantom characters auto-hunt the field zones, so the
  world outside town isn't empty either.
- **Recruitable parties** - shout *Looking for Members / Looking for Party* and a
  level-matched party spawns, walks over, and joins you.
- **Personal support buddy** - party a phantom as your own dedicated buffer/healer.
- **Living chat (optional)** - an optional LLM "brain" lets bots hold in-character
  whisper / say / trade / shout conversations. Fully optional; the server runs without it.

Everything else is stock **Interlude (Chronicle 6 / CT_0)** gameplay from the L2J Mobius
core - augmentation, Seven Signs, sieges, raids, the full quest and skill set.

## Quick start (Windows, install nothing)

The easiest way to play. You do **not** need Java, a database, or any setup.

1. Download the latest **`version release`** from the
   [**Releases**](../../releases) page. DO NOT download the patch if it's your first download. Download the normal version.
2. Unzip it anywhere.
3. Double-click **`LivingWorld.exe`** and press **Play**.

`LivingWorld.exe` is the launcher and the only thing you run: one **Play** button walks
through the whole start sequence (database, first-run setup, login and game servers, and
the optional chat brain) behind a progress bar, with a status light for each piece. On
first run it initializes a bundled, portable MariaDB, imports the schema, then starts the
servers - a bundled JDK and database are inside the zip, so there's nothing to install.
Later runs start straight up. The launcher also carries a **Config Editor** and a
**Modules** panel (see [Configuration](#configuration)) and a one-click **Update** that
never touches your database or your customized config. Use the launcher's **Stop** button
(or `Stop-Server.bat`) to shut everything down cleanly.

**`WARNING`**
If the server did not close down gracefully, it might have leftover items that prevent it from starting again. If that happens, you need to delete the **`.processes.json`** in the launcher folder. It is a hidden file, so make sure you can see hidden files through Windows settings.

Then connect your **Interlude game client** to the server (see
[Connecting the client](#connecting-the-client) below) and log in:

- Accounts are **auto-created on first login** - just type any username and password.
- Log in with the username **`admin`** (any password) to get a **GM account**: every
  character on the `admin` account is automatically granted master access on entering the
  world, so admin commands (`//admin`, etc.) work out of the box - no database editing.
- **Any other username** creates a **normal player account** with no admin rights.

> The pack is large (~0.5 GB) because a full JDK and a database engine are bundled
> inside it. That is the price of "installs nothing."

### Connecting the client

You need a **Lineage 2 Interlude** client (the server does not ship one).

- **Easiest - pre-configured L2.exe:** find and download an interlude client and then
  download the ready-to-play l2.exe from **[here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/4rom0v9yuc7za4y/L2.exe/file)**. It's already
  set to connect to `127.0.0.1`, so just run it and log in.
  WARNING - Rename the existing "L2.exe" of your client to "L2.bin" and replace it with the new "L2.exe" from the link provided above.
- **Manual** - if you don't want the provided l2.exe point your client at the local server by editing the
  client's `system/l2.ini` so the login server host is `127.0.0.1` (or add a `hosts`
  entry mapping the login server's hostname to `127.0.0.1`). Then launch and log in.

> The Lineage 2 client is NCSOFT's property; distribute or download it at your own
> discretion, the same as any fan project.

## Optional: the LLM chat brain

The bots work fully without this. If you want them to hold natural, in-character
conversations, run the small Python "brain" alongside the server. It's a local Flask
service the game server calls over HTTP.

It needs a model to think with - a **local model via [Ollama](https://ollama.com)** (no
API key, runs on your machine) or a hosted API. **Python is installed automatically** if
you don't already have it.

**If you're using the launcher:** the brain is bundled at `dist\brain\`. Just go to settings
in the launcher and click "set up / configure brain..." and the guide to set it up will come up.
Alternative you can also double-click `dist\brain\setup_brain.bat` - which does the same thing and 
sets everything up.

**If you cloned the source repo:** on Linux/macOS the one-step script does everything:

```bash
cd "L2J_Mobius_CT_0_Interlude github"
./setup_brain.sh          # installs Ollama, pulls a model, sets up a venv, launches
```

On Windows use `setup_brain.bat`. To run it manually:

```bash
cd "L2J_Mobius_CT_0_Interlude github"
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # (Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python fpc_brain.py       # serves http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Configure it with a `.env` file in that folder:

```ini
# Local model (recommended, no key needed):
PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_MODEL=gamma3:12b

# - or - a hosted provider:
# PROVIDER=deepseek
# DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

Then set `StartBrain=true` in `dist/launcher/launcher.ini` (or start it yourself) so the
server talks to it.

## Building from source (maintainers / developers)

You only need this if you want to change the Java server or rebuild the one-click pack.

**Requirements:** a full **JDK 25** (not a JRE - the server compiles datapack scripts at
runtime and needs `javac`) and **Apache Ant**.

Build the server jars:

```bash
cd "L2J_Mobius_CT_0_Interlude github"
ant
```

### Producing the one-click pack

Two ways:

- **In the cloud (no local JDK/Ant needed):** run the **"Build one-click pack"** GitHub
  Action from the repository's **Actions** tab ("Run workflow"). When it finishes,
  download the `L2J-Offline-OneClick` artifact and publish it on the Releases page.
- **Locally on Windows:** from `L2J_Mobius_CT_0_Interlude github/dist/launcher/` run
  `build-pack.bat` (or `build-pack.ps1` with options). It builds the jars, bundles a full
  JDK 25 and a portable MariaDB, and produces `L2J-Offline-OneClick.zip`.

See `dist/launcher/README.md` for the full build-and-run details, launcher options, and
the external-database path (running against your own MySQL/XAMPP instead of the bundled
DB).

---

## Configuration

The easy way is built into the launcher. Click **Config Editor** and a visual panel opens
as its own window, already pointed at your server files, so every tab is ready with no
setup: **rates and server settings**, phantom playstyles, bot clans, and the fake-player
**population map**. You change things without editing a single file, and a save rewrites
only the values you touched while keeping your comments and layout intact. The **Modules**
button enables, disables, or removes optional feature modules the same way (see [Modules](#modules)).

Prefer to edit by hand? Every setting still lives in plain files: standard L2J Mobius
`.ini` files under `L2J_Mobius_CT_0_Interlude github/dist/game/config/`, the custom
"Living World" options under `config/Custom/` (e.g. `FakePlayers.ini`), and the XML
behaviour/route files under `dist/game/data/`. Rates, spawns, and the fake-player
populations are all adjustable there too.

---

## Modules

The server supports **modules**: optional features packaged as a self-contained folder that you add
without rebuilding anything. Examples are an NPC buffer, a class master, a GM shop, or extra menus for
calling phantoms into your party.

Reviewed modules are published in the
[**L2 Living Worlds Modules**](https://github.com/Teravibes/L2-Living-Worlds-Modules-) repository,
which lists each one with its author and a short description.

To install a module:

1. Copy its folder into your server's `game/modules/` directory, so you end up with
   `game/modules/<module-id>/`.
2. Open the launcher's **Modules** panel and make sure the module is enabled.
3. Restart the server. The module takes effect on the next start.

To remove one, disable it in the launcher and delete its folder.

> Modules are executable code and run with your server's permissions. Only the modules in the
> modules repository have been reviewed. Install modules from anywhere else at your own risk.

Want to write your own? See [docs/MODULE_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md](docs/MODULE_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md) and
[docs/MODULE_FRAMEWORK.md](docs/MODULE_FRAMEWORK.md), then submit it through the server's Discord
as described in the modules repository.

/**
 * Pure rules for the playstyle fallback in {@link PhantomPlaystyleEngine#pickFallback}: when no playstyle entry fires
 * this tick, a phantom may cast one of its own offensive skills that its playstyle does not list (a level 80 Spectral
 * Dancer whose list only has Arrest left). The damage score is adapted from L2Solo's power versus MP heuristic:
 * stronger hits win and MP cost counts against. The flat score for a pure debuff is this project's own, and it ranks
 * a debuff below any damage skill, so important debuffs belong in the playstyles (FPC-134). Everything here takes
 * plain values, so it is unit tested in {@code tests/java/PhantomSkillFallbackRulesTest.java}.

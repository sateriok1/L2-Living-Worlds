/**
 * Real-Player phantom system.
 * <p>
 * A phantom is a genuine {@link Player} database object with no client attached - the same
 * clientless-Player pattern Mobius ships for offline traders / offline-play
 * ({@code OfflineTraderTable}, {@code OfflinePlayTable}). That gives it real skills, inventory, stats,
 * leveling and PvP eligibility an NPC cannot have.
 * <p>
 * <b>Combat is delegated to the engine's native auto-hunt</b> ({@link AutoPlayTaskManager} +
 * {@link AutoUseTaskManager}) - the exact systems {@code OfflinePlayTable.restoreOfflinePlayers}
 * uses to make a clientless player farm. They handle target selection, movement (geodata
 * pathfinding), attacking, skills, buffs, soulshots and potions. This manager owns the <b>macro</b>
 * layer: data-driven deployment from {@code data/PhantomPopulations.xml}, gearing, supervision and
 * death-respawn.
